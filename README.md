# parser-nodejs

## THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT. PLEASE, DO NOT USE IT.

## Usage

1. Go to the Go parser directory and run `./compile.sh`.
2. Run `import.sh` in this repo. The current script assumes the parser is in a directory called `parser` in the same level as this repo. Please, change the script accordingly if that's not your case.
3. Run `node parser.js`.
